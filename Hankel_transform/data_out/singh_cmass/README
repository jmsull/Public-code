- File naming convention: "shape_density.dat"

- 'cmass.dat' file has basic information for lowz galaxies. The missing
  entries in this file use fill value of -999.

- Column names are given in file header.

- For details of estimators, sample definitions see

  cross: (SD-SRd-DRs+RsRd)/RsRd
  auto: S=D in cross eq. above
  
  S stands for shape sample and D for density tracer.
  The rationale for doing this is that we don't have shapes for all
  galaxies but we can still use them as density tracers to improve S/N.

- Almost all results are cross-correlations, where density sample
  doesnot have shapes. Hence 'w++' will be zero.

- The shape and density sample will always have the same 'z' cuts.
  CMASS cut: 0.45<z<0.70

- Luminosity samples are defined in z-bins as explained in Singh+ 2015.

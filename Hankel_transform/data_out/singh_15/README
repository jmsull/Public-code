- File naming convention: "shape_density.dat"

- 'lowz.dat' file has basic information for lowz galaxies. The missing
  entries in this file use fill value of -999.

- Column names are given in file header.

- For details of estimators, sample definitions see http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1755

- Almost all results are cross-correlations, where density sample
  doesnot have shapes. Hence 'w++' will be zero.

- The shape and density sample will always have the same 'z' cuts.
  z1: 0.16<z<0.26
  z2: 0.26<z<0.36

- Luminosity samples are defined in z-bins as explained in Singh+ 2015.
